Also a list of child components are being stored in the object, and the constructor ensures that any decendant will register itself with it's owner as a child.</p><p><remark>Perhaps I could consider making an interface for the TLogger class an making a decendant that implements it - in order for people with other logging suits to be able to switch the logger - dependancy injection.</remark>
